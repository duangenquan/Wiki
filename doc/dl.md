[AWS Deep Lens](https://thenewstack.io/deep-dive-amazon-deeplens/) acts as an intelligent device that can run deep learning algorithms on captured images in real-time. It is an [AI camera](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/amazons-aws-deeplens-is-an-ai-camera-for-developers/) for developers.

[Google Vision Kit](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/vision/) lets you build your own intelligent camera that can see and recognize objects using machine learning.

[webrtcH4cKS](https://webrtchacks.com/) has recently posted a very interesting article about a computer vision project that makes use of *UV4L* for real-time streaming of video and data over *WebRTC* from a *Raspberry Pi Zero* connected to a *AIY Vision* board. The board embeds a Vision Processing Unit (VPU) chip that runs [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) image processing graphs super efficiently.

The article is divided in two parts:

- [part 1](https://webrtchacks.com/aiy-vision-kit-tensorflow-uv4l-webrtc/)
- [part 2](https://webrtchacks.com/aiy-vision-kit-uv4l-web-server/)
