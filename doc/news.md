  + Autonomous driving systems become an ethical imperative if the systems cause fewer accidents than human drivers.
  + Human safety must always take top priority over damage to animals or property.
  + In the event of an unavoidable accident, any discrimination based on age, gender, race, physical attributes, or any other distinguishing factors are impermissible.
  + In any driving situation, the party responsible, whether human or computer, must be clearly regulated and apparent.
  + For liability purposes, a “black box” of driver data must always be documented and stored.
  + Drivers retain sole ownership over whether or not their vehicle data is forwarded or used by third parties.
  + While vehicles may react autonomously in the event of emergency situations, humans shall regain control during more morally ambiguous events.
