## Node JS Tutorial

NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side. The tutorials include basic / common concepts in node.js modified from [Node.js-Tutorial](https://github.com/MartinChavez/Node.js-Tutorial):

- [x] **Events**: NodeJS triggers events and handles the callback functions.
- [x] **Streams** are like channels, where data flows through, including readable and writable data streams.
- [x] **Pipe** writes to a writeable stream as soon as you read from a readable stream.
- [x] **NPM** (node package manager), manages modules inside the "node_moduls" directory.
- [x] **Express** is a web development framework.
- [x] **Socket.io** allows the creation of connections between clients and servers in real time.
- [x] **Redis** is an open source in-memory data structure store.
